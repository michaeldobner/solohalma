## Why SPRING

SPRING turns the old wooden board game into a calm, tactile experience. A round, deep blue board, glossy blue and black marbles, and sounds tuned like a small instrument. No ads, no accounts, no tracking. It opens in the browser, installs to the home screen like an app and works offline.

## Highlights

| | |
|---|---|
| **7 figures** | From the gentle *Cross* with 6 marbles to the *Classic* board with 32, every one verified as solvable |
| **Switch any time** | Change the figure during play. The board rebuilds itself and a new game begins |
| **Hints** | A built-in solver shows the next correct move, right from the current position |
| **Living rim** | Captured marbles roll into the rim. Tap or swipe them and they roll, bump and settle with real physics |
| **Tilt** | Optional: tilt your iPhone and the marbles in the rim roll downhill |
| **Sound design** | Ceramic on wood in four layers, tuned to a pentatonic scale that rises with your progress. Three styles: Warm, Clear, Soft |
| **Stars** | Up to three stars per figure, best result and number of solves are saved |
| **Bilingual** | German on German devices, English everywhere else |
| **Made for Apple devices** | iPhone portrait and landscape, iPad with a permanent sidebar, light and dark mode, respects the silent switch |

## How to play

1. A marble jumps **horizontally or vertically** over a neighbouring marble into an empty hole.
2. The marble jumped over is removed and rolls into the rim.
3. The game ends when no more jumps are possible.

**Goal:** leave one marble, ideally in the centre. Full rules, scoring and tips: [Gameplay](docs/en/gameplay.md).

## Install on iPhone or iPad

1. Open **https://michaeldobner.github.io/solohalma/** in **Safari**.
2. Tap **Share**, then **Add to Home Screen**.
3. Done. SPRING opens full screen like an app and also works without internet.

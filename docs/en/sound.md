# Sound design

[Deutsche Version](../de/klang.md) · [Overview](README.md)

## Goal

A ceramic marble landing on a wooden board: warm, round, with a short bright ring and a touch of room. Like a fine object in a living room, not like a slot machine.

All sounds are synthesised live in the browser with the Web Audio API (`js/sound.js`). There are no audio files, so SPRING stays small, works fully offline and every sound can be tuned precisely.

## Anatomy of a jump

| Layer | Heard as | Implementation | Length |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Contact | Precise touch | Noise, high frequencies only (high pass 3.5 kHz) | 4 ms |
| 2. Wood | Warm, round "tock" | Sine around 190 Hz, pitch falls slightly | 60 ms |
| 3. Ceramic | Bright, noble ring | Three partials at 1 : 2.76 : 5.4 with 100 %, 32 % and 10 % level | 160, 85, 45 ms |
| 4. Room | Space, not a reverb effect | Convolution with a synthetic 0.55 s room | Amount depends on the style |

The partial ratio 1 : 2.76 : 5.4 is that of a freely vibrating body. It sounds like ceramic or glass instead of an electronic beep.

## Tuning

* The ceramic is tuned to the **major pentatonic scale** (root C5 at 523.25 Hz). Pentatonic notes sound consonant in any order, even in quick succession.
* **The game becomes a melody:** from the first move to the last marble the pitch climbs step by step across ten degrees of the scale, almost two octaves.
* **Liveliness:** every sound varies randomly by ±2 % in pitch and ±12 % in level, so no jump sounds exactly like the one before.

## All sounds

| Moment | Sound | Peak level |
|---|---|---|
| Lift a marble | Almost inaudible, soft tap | about −40 dB |
| Jump lands | Four layers, pitch follows progress | about −12 dB |
| Undo | Like a landing, quieter and two steps lower | about −17 dB |
| Marble rolls into the rim | Deeper wood, soft ceramic click | about −21 dB |
| Marbles bump in the rim | Fine click, level follows impact | −25 to −35 dB |
| Invalid marble | Two muted, low wooden knocks | about −19 dB |
| Figure solved | Rising triad with a long decay | about −11 dB |
| Masterful | Plus a fourth note and a bell tone | about −10 dB |

Levels were measured with an `OfflineAudioContext`. The loudest sound peaks around −10 dB, which leaves headroom and avoids clipping.

## Mastering

All sounds run through the same chain:

```
sounds ─┬─► dry ───────────────┐
        └─► room (convolver) ──┴─► low pass ─► compressor ─► master ─► speaker
```

| Stage | Setting | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Low pass | 5.2 to 10 kHz depending on the style | Removes harshness, important on small speakers |
| Compressor | Threshold −18 dB, ratio 3 : 1, attack 3 ms, release 120 ms | Keeps peaks together, sounds fuller |
| Master | 0.8 | Headroom against clipping |

## Sound styles

| Style | Wood | Ceramic | Room | Low pass | Character |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Warm** (default) | 100 % | 55 % | 10 % | 7 kHz | Round, earthy, calm |
| **Clear** | 55 % | 100 % | 9 % | 10 kHz | Bright, precise, glassy |
| **Soft** | 75 % | 60 % | 24 % | 5.2 kHz | Muted, with more room |

Choosing a style in the settings immediately plays a short preview of three rising jumps.

## So it never gets annoying

* At most 8 clicks per second from the rim and at least 45 ms between two clicks.
* Very gentle bumps stay silent.
* No constant noise: rolling is silent, only bumps can be heard, also while tilting.
* SPRING respects the iPhone's **silent switch** (`navigator.audioSession.type = 'ambient'` where available).
* iOS only enables sound when a finger is lifted or on a complete tap, and pauses it again after switching apps. SPRING therefore checks on every such touch whether sound is running, resumes it if needed and plays a silent sound that reliably unlocks Safari.

## Tweaking

All values are at the top of `js/sound.js`:

| Constant | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `PENTATONIC` | Scale in semitones |
| `BASE_HZ` | Root of the ceramic |
| `CERAMIC_RATIOS`, `CERAMIC_GAINS`, `CERAMIC_DECAYS` | Ceramic partials |
| `SOUND_STYLES` | The three sound styles |

A new sound style is one more entry in `SOUND_STYLES` plus a button in `index.html` and a translation in `js/i18n.js`.
